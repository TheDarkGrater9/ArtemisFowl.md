The Butlers had been serving the Fowls for centuries. It had always been that way. Indeed, there
were several eminent linguists of the opinion that this was how the common noun had originated. The
first record of this unusual arrangement was when Virgil Butler had been contracted as servant,
bodyguard, and cook to Lord Hugo de FolÂ´e for one of the first great Norman crusades.
At the age of ten, Butler children were sent to a private training center in Israel, where they were
taught the specialized skills necessary to guard the latest in the Fowl line. These skills included
Cordon Bleu cooking, marksmanship, a customized blend of martial arts, emergency medicine, and
information technology. If, at the end of their training, there was not a Fowl to guard, then the Butlers
were eagerly snapped up as bodyguards for various royal personages, generally in Monaco or Saudi
Arabia.

Once a Fowl and a Butler were put together, they were paired for life. It was a demanding job,
and lonely, but the rewards were handsome if you survived to enjoy them. If not, then your family
received a six-figure settlement plus a monthly pension.

The current Butler had been guarding young Master Artemis for twelve years, since the moment
of his birth. And, though they adhered to the age-old formalities, they were much more than master
and servant. Artemis was the closest thing Butler had to a friend, and Butler was the closest Artemis
had to a father, albeit one who obeyed orders.
