“That is no concern of yours. All you need to know are your options.”

The sprite’s pointed ears quivered. “Options?”

“One, you refuse to give us the Book and we go home, leaving you to rot in this sewer.”

“Yes,” said the fairy. “I choose this option.”

“Ah, no. Don’t be so eager. If we leave without the Book, you will be dead in a day.”

“A day! A day!” the healer laughed. “I will outlive you by a century. Even fairies tethered to the
human realm can survive the ages.”

“Not with half a pint of holy water inside them,” said Artemis, tapping the now empty whiskey
bottle.

The fairy blanched, then screamed, a high keening horrible sound.
“Holy water! You have murdered me, human.”

“True,” admitted Artemis. “It should start to burn any minute now.”

The fairy poked her stomach tentatively. “The second option?”

“Listening now, are we? Very well then. Option two. You give me the Book for thirty minutes
only. Then I return your magic to you.”

The sprite’s jaw dropped. “Return my magic? Not possible.”

“Oh, but it is. I have in my possession two ampoules.
One, a vial of spring water from the fairy well sixty meters below the ring of Tara—possibly the
most magical place on earth. This will counteract the holy water.”

“And the other?”

“The other is a little shot of man-made magic. A virus that feeds on alcohol, mixed with a growth
agent. It will flush every drop of rice wine from your body, remove the dependence, and even bolster
your failing liver. It’ll be messy, but after a day you’ll be zipping around as though you were a
thousand years old again.”

The sprite licked her lips. To be able to rejoin the People? Tempting.

“How do I know to trust you, human? You have tricked me once already.”

“Good point. Here’s the deal. I give you the water on faith. Then, after I’ve had a look at the
Book, you get the booster. Take it or leave it.”

The fairy considered. The pain was already curling around her abdomen. She thrust out her wrist.
“I’ll take it.”
