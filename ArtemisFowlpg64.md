A waiter scurried to their table.

“More tea, sirs?” he asked, head bobbing furiously.

Artemis sighed. “Spare me the theatrics, and sit down.”

The waiter turned instinctively to Butler, who was after all, the adult.
“But, sir, I am the waiter.”

Artemis tapped the table for attention.
“You are wearing handmade loafers, a silk shirt, and three gold signet rings. Your English has a
tinge of Oxford about it, and your nails have the soft sheen of the recently manicured. You are not a
waiter. You are our contact Nguyen Xuan, and you have adopted this pathetic disguise to discreetly
check for weaponry.”

Nguyen’s shoulders sagged. “It is true. Amazing.”

“Hardly. A ragged apron does not a waiter make.”

-Artemis Fowl, Book One, Chapter One, pg 7
